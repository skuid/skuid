# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. Pull Requests will be merged pending the approval of at least one of the project maintainers after agreement on the value of the contribution has been reached.

## Testing

All new features should come with Unit Tests to ensure that the interfaces used in the project can be maintained going forward. If the
feature has no external interactions this is a hard requirement.
